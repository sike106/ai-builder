# JEE Challenger

JEE Challenger is an AI-driven personal tutor prototype that generates practical learning missions for JEE concepts and pairs them with interactive visual simulations.

## Features

- **AI Concept Studio**: Enter a concept prompt and get a focused learning mission instantly.
- **Interactive Simulation Lab**: Tune projectile parameters and visualize trajectory with live metrics.
- **Quick Challenge Zone**: Adaptive practice questions generated by topic.
- **Admin Content Upload**: Upload topic packs in JSON format to add/override missions and challenge questions from the UI.
- **Working Tabs**: Use top navigation tabs to switch between Studio, Simulation, Challenges, and Admin sections.

## Admin upload format

Use this JSON structure:

```json
{
  "kinematics": {
    "mission": "Master relative motion through graph-based intuition and equation mapping.",
    "challenge": [
      "How do you derive relative velocity in 2D?",
      "What changes in river-boat crossing when flow speed doubles?"
    ]
  }
}
```

Current demo admin key: `jee-admin-2026`
